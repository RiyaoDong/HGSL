# HGSL
Hard global softmin loss for fine-grained object retrieval.

Implementation of Hard global softmin loss for fine-grained object retrieval.

## Requirements
```
Python 3, PyTorch >= 1.1.0
```

## Datasets preparation

We conduct our experiments on four popular fine-grained datasets, e.g. CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, FGVC aircraft, Oxford Flowers.
You can prepare the dadasets youself, or just download the datasets we packed from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CYTeZ8VooiC8AUKDyvJvivc_swbN42dI/view?usp=sharing

## Training ResNet50 on CUB with HGSL

```
./train.sh
```
